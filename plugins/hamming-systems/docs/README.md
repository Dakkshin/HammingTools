# HammingTools - Systems Auditor (Claude Code Plugin)

A Claude Code plugin for rigorous systems engineering analysis inspired by
Richard W. Hamming's *Systems Engineering*.

  boundaries, interactions, failure modes, redundancy, trade-offs, evolution.

## When to use
- Architecture reviews
- Design docs
- Postmortems
- Early product/system planning

## Philosophy
This tool enforces whole-system thinking, avoids local optimization,
and emphasizes graceful degradation and long-term evolution.
